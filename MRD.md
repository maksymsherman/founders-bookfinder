## Book Link Extraction Strategy

### Recommended LLM Approach

**Primary Method: Google Gemini**

Use a structured prompt like:
```
Analyze the following podcast episode description and extract any book recommendations mentioned. For each book found, provide:

1. Book title (exact as mentioned)
2. Author name
3. Any direct purchase links (Amazon, bookstore links)

Respond in JSON format:
{
  "books": [
    {
      "title": "Book Title",
      "author": "Author Name",
      "links": ["url1", "url2"],
    }
  ]
}
```

**Alternative Methods:**
- Use named entity recognition (NER) for initial book/author detection
- Implement regex patterns for common book mention formats
- Use book title databases for validation
- Combine multiple methods for higher accuracy
